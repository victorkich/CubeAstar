## Environment
<p align="justify"> 
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/IlQDpai.png" alt="CubeAstar" align="right" width="320">
  <a>This project has the purpose of elucidating in a graphic way the functioning of the pathfinding algorithm A* in a tri-dimentional interface. However, it can be used to perform some kind of academic research about it.</a>  
</p>
  

## Setup
<p align="justify"> 
 <a>All of requirements is show in the badgets above, but if you want to install all of them, enter the repository and execute the following line of code:</a>
</p>

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Objectives
<p align="justify"> 
  The environment generates parameterized obstacles in a random way and its actuation interval can also be configured. The green point is the starting point of the search algorithm and the red point the end point, the objective. To perform tests using the "maximum speed" of processing I strongly recommend disabling the graphical interface by changing the <i><b>PLOT</b></i> parameter to <i><b>False</b></i>.
